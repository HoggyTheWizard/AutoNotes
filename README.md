# AutoNotes
A personal project I'm making so that I don't have to waste my time doing note assignments.

For those of you who want to use it:
1. Make a file called something like `terms.txt`
2. Put your terms in there, each term on a newline (Avoid descriptions. If your term is "John Adams, President of the United States", make it "John Adams")
3. Run the script like this: `python main.py -i <your input file> -o <output filename>`.
4. Optionally, you can use the `-I` (`--interactive`) flag that allows you to correct terms that couldn't be found/were too ambiguous.

Note: This is a quick script I made for my own personal use. Unless something is an easy fix, I likely won't be changing the code to support new things.

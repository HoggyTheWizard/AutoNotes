# AutoNotes
A personal project I'm making so that I don't have to waste my time doing note assignments.

For those of you who want to use it:
1. Create file `terms.txt`
2. Put your terms in there, each term on a newline
3. Avoid descriptions.  If your term is "John Adams, President of the United States", make it "John Adams"
4. This is a quick script I made for my own personal. Unless something is an easy fix, I likely won't be changing the 
code to support new things.
